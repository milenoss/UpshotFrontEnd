## Project title
Upshot lets users create and organise events anywhere around the world. It can be useful for small office events and can be used among friends. It will save time from organising it over the phone or a group chat message. It updates on real-time and lets users real-time comments on each others events.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to demonstrate my understanding and learning in React, Redux, Semantics and using Firebase Cloud.
The project can be useful for office events or creating family events where all users can see what events are up and can be used efficiently.
